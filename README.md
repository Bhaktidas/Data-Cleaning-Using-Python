# Data Cleaning Project Using Python

This project is designed to help data analysts and scientists clean and preprocess datasets using Python. The project includes a set of scripts and modules for common data cleaning tasks, as well as a set of examples and tutorials to help users get started with cleaning their own data.


## Installation

To use the Data Cleaning Project, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website.

Once you have installed Python, you can download the project files from our repository:
https://github.com/Bhaktidas/Data-Cleaning-Using-Python


You can then install the required Python libraries by running the following command in the project directory:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all of the necessary dependencies, including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.



    
## Usage/Examples

To use the data cleaning scripts, you can run the following command in the project directory:

python clean_data.py

This will run the main data cleaning script, which will prompt you to enter the filename of the dataset you want to clean. You can then choose from a variety of data cleaning options, including removing duplicates, filling in missing values, and transforming data types.

You can also use the Jupyter notebooks provided in the "notebooks" directory to explore and clean datasets interactively. These notebooks include examples of common data cleaning tasks and techniques, as well as sample datasets to practice on.
